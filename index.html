        <h1>ABOUT THE SHOW</h1>
        <p>Winner of 7 Emmy Awards, including Outstanding Comedy Series. Jason Sudeikis is an American college football coach, who is unexpectedly recruited to manage an English Premier League team, AFC Richmond, despite having no experience coaching
          soccer. Lasso is hired by new owner Rebecca Welton in hope that he would be a failure so she could enact revenge on her unfaithful ex-husband who was the previous owner of the team, however Ted's charm, personality and humour begins to win
          round Rebecca, the team and those who had been skeptical about his appointment.</p>
